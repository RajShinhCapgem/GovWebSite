Create a single-page Node.js Express app using GOV.UK Design System named vetvisits inside the current folder for farmers to register animals for vet visits,  page for selecting the species the farmer has, and on the next page adding the animal count based on the sub categories of that species i.e., ewes. 

This application MUST follow the GOV.UK Design System standards to ensure consistency with government services. All code should use the official GOV.UK Frontend components, styles, and patterns.

Use Context7 constantly (govuk-design-system, nunjucks etc) to ensure you get the correct libraries, styles, codes, any learnings you have from there.
